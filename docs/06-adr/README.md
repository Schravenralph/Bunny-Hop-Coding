# Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records documenting important architectural decisions made in the project.

## What are ADRs?

ADRs document the context, decision, and consequences of important architectural choices. They help future developers understand why certain decisions were made.

## ADR Format

Each ADR should include:
- **Status**: Proposed, Accepted, Rejected, Deprecated, Superseded
- **Context**: The issue motivating this decision
- **Decision**: The change that we're proposing or have agreed to implement
- **Consequences**: What becomes easier or more difficult to do because of this change
